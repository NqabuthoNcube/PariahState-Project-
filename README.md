# Pariah State ZW â€“ Front End Mockup Project

## Project Overview
This is a small front end mockup project I did for my **Advanced Web Technology** class, as a **BCA student at Galgotias University**. I worked on it with a friend pursuing **BSc. Computer Science**, who assisted with the basic structuring of the front-end development.

## Purpose
The project showcases basic use of:
- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for interactive elements

## Features
- Responsive navigation across multiple pages (Home, Menu, Reserve, Order, Contact)
- Interactive table booking system with visual feedback
- Day/Night theme toggle
- Simplified order form for simulated food ordering
- Consistent visual style across pages

## How to Use
1. Extract the `.zip` file.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
3. Navigate through the tabs to explore different features.
