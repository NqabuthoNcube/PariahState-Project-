# PariahState-Project-
This is a small front end mockup project I did for my Advanced Web Technology class, as a BCA student at Galgotias University. I worked on it with a friend doing Bsc.CS just for a helping hand in basic structuring of the front end development. The project show cases basic uses of CSS, HTML and JavaScript in creating front end webpages.
